### Instructions

- This notebook demostrates a method for solving the impulse response function for incomplete information general equilibrium model. The technical detail is discussed in a companion note: [Solving Incomplete Information General Equilibrium Models in Sequence Space](https://chiukwokyan.github.io/research/solve_incompleteInfo_SequenceSpace.pdf)

- To run this notebook, you need to install Jupyter notebook and Julia. Please this guide on QuantEcon: [Setting up Your Julia Environment](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html)
